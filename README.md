<h3>This repository was created for Lab 05 of Database Applications(CSD220) at Sault College&emsp;<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/ee/Sault_College_logo.png"
width="25"></h3>
<p>The purpose of this lab is to write an application using a database</p>
<h4>Here is the overview of the lab:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You work for a superhero consulting agency and you have been tasked with writing an application to help the agency hire out superheroes with skills relevant to 
specific tasks.  For example, the Candian government recently hired your agency to assist in its polar defense program, for which the agency must recruit several 
superheroes with the powers of flight and telepathy (so that they can traverse the arctic quickly and report suspicious behaviours immediately to the appropriate 
officials).</li>
<li>The application you write must be able to track information about individual superheroes.  Specifically, the app must be able to record for each superhero a name 
(e.g. Superman), an alias (e.g. Clark Kent), and an email address at which the hero may be contacted.  The app must also record a list of ‘skills’ that various 
superheroes may possess (e.g. X-Ray vision, flight, telepathy, etc.)  It must be possible to associate each superhero with the complete set of skills they possess, 
and it must be possible to associate the same skill with multiple superheroes.  (For example, both Superman and Ironman have the power of flight.)</li>
</ul>
